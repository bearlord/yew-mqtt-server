/**
 * Handles the creation of table `{{%mqtt_message_trace}}`.
 *
 * Full-lifecycle tracing for a message: every meaningful event from the moment
 * a PUBLISH is received until it is acknowledged/delivered to each subscriber is
 * appended as a row. This gives an end-to-end view of a message's path through
 * the broker (ingest -> store -> route -> per-subscriber deliver -> ack stages ->
 * offline buffering -> final delivery).
 *
 * trace_type values (extend as needed):
 *   1: publish_received   - PUBLISH arrived at the broker (up leg)
 *   2: stored             - persisted to mqtt_message
 *   3: retained           - stored as retained message
 *   4: offline_buffered   - buffered as offline message (subscriber offline)
 *   5: delivered          - forwarded to a subscriber (down leg)
 *   6: puback             - QoS1 PUBACK received from subscriber
 *   7: pubrec             - QoS2 PUBREC received from subscriber
 *   8: pubrel             - QoS2 PUBREL received from subscriber / sent to subscriber
 *   9: pubcomp            - QoS2 PUBCOMP received from subscriber
 *  10: ack_completed      - acknowledgement terminal state reached
